## History of the Breed

Unlike some dog breeds, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi does not have a traceable breed history. Its origins are obscured by tales and folklore and even contain ties to the wee folk of the British Isles.

According to legend, two children tending their family's cattle on royal lands found a pair of puppies, which they thought were foxes. When they brought the puppies home, they were told the dogs were a gift from the fairies. Welsh legends tell us that the fairies would use the little dogs to pull their carriages or as mounts for them to ride into battle. If you look, you can still see the marks of the fairy saddle on their shoulders (especially pronounced in the sable color). As the little puppies that the children brought home grew, they learned to help their humans watch over their cattle, a task to become a responsibility for their descendants for the centuries to follow.

The more commonly accepted theory traces back to Scandinavian raiders bringing their dogs with them to the British Isles, possibly as far back as the 9th or 10th century. The Swedish Vallhund is seen to bear many similarities to today's Pembroke Welsh Corgi and is presumed to have been bred with native Welsh dogs. Any of the offspring that expressed cattle herding/driving traits were no doubt selectively bred to enhance that skill. It is also thought that the dogs brought over with Flemish weavers, who settled in Pembrokeshire, South Wales in the 12th century, were bred with the local cattle dogs adding the Spitz characteristics that the Pembroke Welsh Corgi expresses today.

The name of the breed is as difficult to nail down as is its origin. One school combines the Welsh word "cor," which means "to watch over or gather" with "gi," a form of the Welsh word for dog. This was certainly a responsibility of these small cattle herders and homestead guardians. Another ascribes the word corgi as the Celtic word for dog and that the Norman invaders thereafter referred to any local dog as a "cur" or mongrel. Finally, legend pops up again with the interpretation that the word "cor" means "dwarf." Combine that with the Welsh form for dog "gi" and you have "dog of the dwarfs or "dwarf dog." For many years Corgis (both breeds) were referred to as either "Ci-llathed" meaning "yard long dog" (we're talking a Welsh yard here) or as "Ci Sawdlo" due to its nature of nipping at cattle's heels.

The Pembroke Welsh Corgi sheds extensively, often daily, with coat "blow outs" often twice a year. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has erect ears which are in proportion to the equilateral triangle of the head. The ears should also be firm, medium in size, and tapered slightly to a rounded point. The head should be "foxy" in shape and appearance. Pembroke Welsh Corgis differ from the Cardigan Welsh Corgi by being shorter in length, having smaller ears, and being slightly straighter of leg. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has a "fairy saddle", somewhat lighter markings on each side of the withers caused by changes in the thickness, length, and direction of hair growth. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi sheds mostly in the spring and autumn and may shed annually, with intact females shedding during heat.

Breed faults exist; some which may acknowledge genetic health conditions such as "fluffies" which are corgis with very long coats, and "bluies," which have a dilute colour (red coats present with a bluish cast).

Some Pembroke Welsh Corgis are born with their tail naturally short or missing. Others may have their tails docked between 2–5 days old due to historical tradition or in order to conform to the Breed Standard. Artificial docking was needed for the dog to do its job as a herding dog in the United Kingdom. A non-herding, "companion" dog was considered a luxury under tax law, and attracted a tax, so to demonstrate that their dogs were herding dogs, owners had to ensure the dogs had docked or bobbed tails. The Kennel Club, the United Kennel Club, and the FCI allow intact tails in Conformation shows. The AKC Standard states tails should be docked no longer than 2 inches (5 cm). In many countries, docking has been deemed illegal.

At a young age, the Queen’s passion for thisbreed started when her father, King George VI, brought home their first royal corgi who was later named “Dookie”. The Queen ceased breeding corgis around 2012 so as not to leave any behind after she dies; her last corgi, Willow, died 18 April 2018.

Queen Elizabeth II’s corgis were the Pembroke Welsh Corgi dogs owned by Queen Elizabeth II and her parents, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Fond of corgis since she was a small child, Elizabeth II has owned more than 30 corgis since she became Queen of the Commonwealth realms in 1952

The royal corgis are known all across the world and have been portrayed in many ways such as statues and works of art. For example, thecrown coinwhich commemorated theGolden Jubilee of Elizabeth IIshows her with a corgi.
